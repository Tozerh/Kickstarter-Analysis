# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

  

### 
The purpose of this project is to provide our customer, Louise, with an analysis of Kickstarter campaign data relevant to her areas of interest: campaign outcomes by launch date and campaign outcomes by funding goals. Because Louise's theater campaign for her own play, *Fever*, is very close to its funding goal, she is very interested in learning more about how her campaign is fairing compared to historical campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  In order to isolate theater campaign outcomes by launch date, I initially filtered the data in my main sheet, 'Kickstarter', using "theater" on the column "Parent Category." Once I applied this filter, I copied and pasted this information into a new sheet "Theater Outcomes by Date" (more on this in the "Challenges and Difficulties..." section below). Once I was able to isolate the "theater" parent category, I inserted a PivotTable based on this data subset and adjusted the labels and filters as required for this project. Once I was satisfied that this pivot table was providing the right data, I created a line chart based on this table, which can be seen here:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  The analysis for this particular deliverable for Louise required collecting a subset of data not with a column filter but with the Excel function "COUNTIFS," which required particular ranges and range criteria to be entered manually for each of the 12 ranges for the "Goal" column. Once I read up on the COUNTIFS function, I came up with the following formula to test output for the number of successful campaigns with a goal of less than 1,000 dollars: 
  
  `=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D,"<1000",Kickstarter!$F:$F,"successful",Kickstarter!$R:$R,"plays")`
  
  Checking this output against the raw dataset, I was confident that I understood the COUNTIFS function well enough to continue with the other ranges. Most of the Kickstarter goal ranges, however, required at least four arguments, and I ended up with the following formula template (after some testing, more on this below...) to adjust as needed: 

`=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D,"<5000",Kickstarter!$D:$D,">=1000",Kickstarter!$F:$F,"failed",Kickstarter!$R:$R,"plays")` 

  Having confirmed the formulae in my data table, I moved on to preparing the line graph to visualize these data, which required some adjustment to the "Series" (y-axis) and "Categories" (x-axis) data. Initially, creating a line graph pulled in all of the data sources in the data table. I was able to adjust the data sources to isolate for only "successful," "failed," and "canceled" campaigns by right clicking on the plot area for this graph to adjust the data sources. Ultimately, I ended up with the following visual representation of the data for outcomes versus launch date:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
